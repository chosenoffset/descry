### Integration Points
1. **Application Startup**: Initialize Descry, load rules, start collection
2. **HTTP Middleware**: Automatic request/response monitoring
3. **Periodic Collection**: Background goroutine feeding metrics to engine
4. **Rule Evaluation**: Continuous evaluation with configurable intervals
5. **Action Execution**: Pluggable system for handling rule triggers

### Security Considerations
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Rules cannot access filesystem or network
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits for rule evaluation
- **Input Validation**: Strict parsing and validation of rule syntax
- **Minimal Privileges**: Library runs with application permissions only
